This project is to answer the universal question in one place.
To rephrase it, let's build a webpage to display the court vacancies.


## TODO

- [ ] Parse booking page from [BTC](https://www.burnabytennis.ca/burnaby/home/readPage.do?id=141)
- [ ] Parse booking page from UBC, Hub, Coquitlam tennis center
- [ ] Define a data storage format (JSON)
- [ ] Build a HTML page to load data and render (mobile friendly)
- [ ] Deploy somewhere and get HTML exposed
- [ ] Add a background job to update data every five minutes
