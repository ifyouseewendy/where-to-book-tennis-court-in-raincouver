# Where to book ðŸŽ¾ court in Raincouver?

> Where can I book a freaking tennis court in Raincouver?

This project is to answer the universal question in one place.
To rephrase it, let's build a webpage to display the court vacancies.


## Note

Background job runs at `bin/run` for every X minutes. It dumps the data into `runner-data.json`, which then gets rendered by `index.html`.

Data is massaged mostly in server side and gets rendered directly in frontend.

## How to add a new venue

1. Add a new entry to `venues.json`
2. Add new scraper in `lib/new_venue_scraper.rb`
3. Add new test in `test/new_venue_scraper_test.rb`
